# coursera-advanced-react-light-dark-theme
This project demonstrates the use of React’s Context API to manage global application state.

It implements a light and dark theme switcher to illustrate how Context can be used to share state across components without relying on prop drilling. This approach improves maintainability and scalability by centralizing shared state and reducing unnecessary component coupling.

### Key Concepts Demonstrated
- React Context API
- Global state management
- Avoiding prop drilling
- Theme-based UI state (light/dark modes)
